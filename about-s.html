            <h2>The Description of the photos above.</h2>
            <h3>Photo on the left</h3>
            <p>The photo on the left was when i first began painting. I only used <em hand and fingers></em> to paint this canvas. I began to use my art as a form of therapy and outlet. I got further into producing art and began to fall into a rythym and quickly painted over 50 paints in the span of three months.</p>

            <h3>Photo on the right</h3>
            <p>The photo on the right is after a year of painting. I discovered the converse style of Richard Hambleton.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hambleton"></a> His work inspired me to produce abstracted art through limited use of the of paint and brush strokes but also using the imagination of the viewers to interpurt the paintings emotional aspects.</p>
